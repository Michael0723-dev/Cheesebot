The metadata we use include: cheese_type, brand, cheese_form, price_each, price_per_lb, lb_per_each, case, sku, upc, image_url, source_url. If the answer can be answered accurately through a pinecone vector database search that includes metadata filtering related to these values, then 1 must be output. But if the user's question now is one that is difficult to answer accurately with a chatbot using the Pinecone vector database. For example, it may be a greeting that is not related to the exact information about cheese, or it may be a question that is difficult to answer accurately with a semantic search using the vector database, in this case the output has to be 0, e.g. finding most expensive cheese, or the heaviest product. and also, it may be a question about a different field that cannot be considered a question from a user using this chatbot to know about cheese. In this case function output has to be 0, Otherwise output has to be 1 that is answerable.
